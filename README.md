[![Tests](https://github.com/gemmadlou/vue-epc-component/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gemmadlou/vue-epc-component/actions/workflows/test.yml)

A little Vue.js component library to display the UK EPC Ratings.

## Usage

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import EPCRating from './components/EPCRating.vue';
</script>

<template>
  <EPCRating :current-score="72" :potential-score="85" />
</template>
```

##Â EPC Ratings

An Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) tells you how energy efficient a property is. Ratings are grated from A-G. The UK Gov website not only states the current energy rating, but the potential rating given recommendations are implemented.

You can find the energy rating for a property here: https://www.gov.uk/find-energy-certificate.
